=====================================================





Introduction
------------

Welcome to the OSM-GPT, where we leverage the power of GPT-3 and the Overpass API to provide a seamless and intuitive experience for discovering features on OpenStreetMap. This project aims to bridge the gap between natural language queries and querying the OpenStreetMap database, making it easy for users to explore and uncover the treasures hidden within.

Features
--------

-   Natural Language Queries: With the assistance of GPT-3, users can effortlessly express their queries in everyday language, eliminating the need to learn complex query languages or syntax.
-   Overpass API Integration: Our project integrates with the powerful Overpass API, which allows us to fetch features from OpenStreetMap based on the interpreted natural language queries.
-   User-Friendly Interface: Our application provides a user-friendly interface that guides users through the process of submitting queries, viewing results, and navigating the mapped features on OpenStreetMap.
